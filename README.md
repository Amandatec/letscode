# 🚀Let´s code (Bora Codar)


This is a repository created to place all my projects from "Bora Codar" by Rocketseat.

## 💻 Project

 "Bora codar" is a weekly challenge where they put a layout on figma every Wednesday at 11am, and we have a week to develop the project and add as many features as we can.

After a week they will give a resolution to the challenge with educator @Maykbrito.
